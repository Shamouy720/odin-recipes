        <li>2 cups chopped yellow onion, medium dice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, washed and dried</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cardamom</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>2½ cups carrots, washed and dried, peeled, approximately ¼ to ½ inch slices</li>
        <li>1 cup celery, washed and dried, peeled (optional), approximately ¼ inch slices</li>
        <li>2 cups dried lentils</li>
        <li>4½ cups vegetable stock</li>
        <li>2¾ cups coconut milk</li>
        <li>4 cups loosely packed spinach leaves, washed and dried, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>chili flakes (if desired)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Sauté the onions and garlic with the thyme and spices. Coat a large pot (5 to 6 quart Dutch Oven is perfect), fitted with a lid, with the grapeseed oil.<br> Place it over medium heat and add the onion and garlic. Sauté for a couple minutes to soften and coat with the oil.<br> Then add the thyme, and all of the spices. Continue to sauté, stirring every so often, until the onions are very soft, <br>and not yet browning, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add remaining vegetables except for the spinach. Add the carrots and celery, stir, and cook for about 5 minutes. Then add lentils and mix to blend.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine and add stock and coconut milk. In a large glass measuring cup (or bowl), whisk the coconut milk with 1 to 2 cups of the stock. <br>Whisk just long enough to smooth out any lumps in the coconut milk. Add this, along with the remaining stock, to the pot and mix to blend.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and simmer until the lentils and carrots are tender, about 1 hour.

        </li>
        <li>
            Add spinach and season. Add the spinach in a few batches, letting each one wilt into the stew before adding the next.<br> Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Here's How to Season to Taste.) Add chili flakes if desired for a bit of heat and serve.
